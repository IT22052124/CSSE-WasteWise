-----------------------------------------------------------
## üèÉ Usage

Below you will find instructions to run the application:

### Web Application

1. **Development Mode:**
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   cd CSSE-WasteWise/Frontend_Web
   npm run dev
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   This command starts the Vite dev server, providing hot module replacement and a fast development experience.

2. **Production Build:**
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   This builds the optimized production version of the app and starts a static server to preview your build.

### Mobile Applications

1. **User and Collector Apps:**
   - Navigate to the Frontend_User or Frontend_mobile directory.
   - Run:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     expo start
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to test the mobile app.

2. **Features in Use:**
   - **Bin Management:** Add new bin types or update existing ones through the web dashboard.
   - **Waste Collection:** Collect waste data and automatically update waste levels (see bin collection controllers in the code).
   - **PDF Generation and Receipts:** Generate PDFs from within the mobile app for bin purchase receipts and waste collection details.

The application is designed to be modular. For example, bin types are managed using specific pages (such as AddBinType and UpdateBinType) to ensure a smooth admin flow (ÓàÄfileciteÓàÇturn0file5ÓàÅ, ÓàÄfileciteÓàÇturn0file6ÓàÅ).
